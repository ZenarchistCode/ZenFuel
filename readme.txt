What Is This?

This mod allows players to use gasoline as kindling on fireplaces to start fires.

You need at least 1000mL of gasoline (equivalent of a full water bottle), and the fireplace must contain at least one piece of firewood or one short stick. 

Either create a fireplace by combining firewood and a short stick, or pour the gasoline directly onto firewood to create a fuel-soaked fireplace.

Once the fire is doused in gasoline it can't be picked up, but you can take the firewood out of it if you need to re-make it somewhere else.

You can only pour fuel on the fire if it does not contain gasoline already. You can also pour gasoline on a lit fire to make it last longer.

It works on all fireplace types - outdoor, indoor, barrels etc.

Known Issues:

After you extinguish a fire using water, for some reason you cannot pour gasoline to re-light it. Will fix when I find time to further investigate.

Installation Instructions:

Install this mod like any other mod - copy it into your server folder and add it to your mods list. It must be run on both server and client. Make sure to copy the .bikey into your server keys.

Repack & Source Code:

You can repack this mod if you like, and do anything else you want with it for that matter. Just keep in mind my future updates won't be applied so make sure to check back for new versions if you notice any bugs. The source code is on my GitHub at www.zenarchist.io

Enjoy!
